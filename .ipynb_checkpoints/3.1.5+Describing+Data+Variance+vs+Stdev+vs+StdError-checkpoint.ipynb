Of course if the data are not normally distributed such interpretation is not valid. It remains that standard deviation can still be used as a measure of dispersion even for non-normally distributed data.\n",

This can also be extended to test (in terms of null hypothesis testing) differences between means. For example if the 95% confidence intervals around the estimated fish sizes under Treatment A do not cross the estimated mean fish size under Treatment B then fish sizes are significantly different from one another between the two Treatments.

If you are interested in the precision of the means or in comparing and testing differences between means then standard error is your metric. Of course deriving confidence intervals around your data (using standard deviation) or the mean (using standard error) requires your data to be normally distributed. Bootstrapping is an option to derive confidence intervals in cases when you are doubting the normality of your data."

    "\n",
    "The reason that variance is useful is that it's more convenient to work with when you're dealing with the underlying math, rather than dealing with actual data. Why? Because you can add two independent variances to get the total variance due to those factors. But, adding one standard deviation to another gives you a meaningless number.\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps when trying to determine the ratio of how much variation comes from one source or another. Example - if the total variance is 100 (sd = 10), and independent source A is responsible for 64 of that variance, while B has 36 of it, that's easy to see (A is responsible for 64% of the variation). If you used SD, A's would be 8, while B's would be 6, but the total is 10. That's much less intuitive to see the proportions (and as mentioned above, 8 + 6 = 14, which is meaningless here)."
