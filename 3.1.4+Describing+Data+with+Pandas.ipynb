Now, we're going to discuss how we can leverage the tools of data science, specifically the _pandas_ package, to quickly and easily describe our data. This is what you'll actually be using day to day when you have to describe or summarize the data you're working with. Rather than draw out formulas or perform calculations you'll use the tools of programming to get the answers you want easily and efficiently.\n",

    "Now, there are many more methods in pandas to describe data in simple aggregative forms. Things like median and variance all have associated pandas methods. As a general rule of thumb, if you're trying to compute a standard statistical measure (the kinds of measures you could find in a statistics book somewhere) Python probably has a coded up method for it somewhere already. Usually that method will be in NumPy and pandas, but not always. It is, however, always worth a quick Google and check of Stack Overflow to see if the work has already been done before you go off and create your own functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The `.describe()` method\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we've mostly talked about methods with two kinds of output: it either stays the same shape with modified values (the iterative kinds of methods) or it condenses the data into a single value output (aggregative methods). There is another group of methods in Pandas, and they happen to be supremely useful for quickly and coherently summarizing data in a numeric rather than visual way. \n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, there are a lot of descriptive values that are often used in concert with each other. The most classic example is probably mean and standard deviation. Using the two of them together gets you a lot of information about how the data is distributed across values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas understands this. Sometimes you want more than one value, but less than all of them. You want a set of summary statistics that give you a good, standardized view into the data and its variables. Enter `.describe()`."

In this case we can see that the distributions for height and weight are higher for men than for women, which is what we'd expect. This kind of grouping can give us another layer of insight to our analysis.\n",
