    "Christmastime will bias availability in two ways- more AirBnBs may be taken due to vacationers, or fewer AirBnBs may be on offer because people don’t want to share their homes over the holidays. Choose a sampling period that doesn’t include a major holiday, or reframe the question to focus on popular neighborhoods during major holidays.\n",
